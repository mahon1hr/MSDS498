       "'I feel like a douche bag for giving Matt\\'s only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain:\\nThis place is a hot spot, every time I\\'ve tried to go there, it\\'s packed.  Each time, I\\'ve never wanted to wait so I went on my way.\\nOne Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can\\'t see what\\'s in front of you cause it\\'s raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt\\'s~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1\\\\/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt\\'s you get to make and stick by the rules you make.\\nDespite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt\\'s because of all the applaudes I\\'ve heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me.\\nI had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt\\'s and that\\'s what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny\\'s portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt\\'s and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where\\'s the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It\\'s a good thing too cause it\\'s far from my house and I hate waiting!,meh. i\\'ve experienced better.,This review is NOT for the food, it is for the wait.  Seriously.... 2 hours PLUS.  \\nWe sat in the hot Arizona sun with my hungry child in a questionable part of town and the only thing I received was a sun burn and major irritation from the wait.\\nAfter waiting 2 hours, that was it for us.  \\n*************************My philosophy is anything tastes pretty damn amazing when you are famished and dehydrated. ********************,First off, lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food (fresh) or the service (excellent).  But seriously, I\\'ve had better.  Contrary to other reviewers, Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be.\\n\\nMom really wanted to try this place, particularly the \"Chop and Chick\" porkchop and eggs dish that Guy had on DDD here and the reason his face is tie-dyed sprayed on the wall with the words \"Guy Ate Here\".  We altered our exit strategy from the Armpit of America (aka Phoenix - 120 degrees at 8am, no sir!) just to sample this mythically delicious dish.\\n\\nThe parking lot is the size of a postage stamp, and while there are several sizable parking lots nearby, you can\\'t park there because it\\'s private property and Phoenix PD don\\'t mess around.  Which leaves metered parking along the streets.  a quarter earns you 10 minutes at Matt\\'s Big Breakfast, and the wait time is about fifty cents on a good day.  You sign your party up on the list near a ceramic pig by the door.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is exceedingly small.  Get to know your neighbors, you\\'ll definitely be talking to them at some point in your meal.\\n\\nI had the organic chocolate milk which tasted exactly like the kind I have at home, an omelet with no special ingredients to set it apart from a Denny\\'s omelet and Belgian waffles that weren\\'t much better than the kind I buy frozen at Costco.  The menu at this Matt\\'s location (I was told there are three around the Phoenix area, each with a more expansive menu than this location) is very limited and the ingredients are too.  No substituting fresh fruit, they don\\'t have any.  That Chop and Chick that cost us $3.00 in metered parking?  I doubt Mom would have given it 2 stars.  Overall, it wasn\\'t a terrible experience, but it wasn\\'t something I\\'d do again.,The single handed worst breakfast experience I\\'ve ever had. The only time I\\'ve ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, \"they don\\'t quote times, but that it goes fast.\" They don\\'t write down the time you arrive so either management doesn\\'t care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become \"pot committed\" and hang out for the table. \\n    Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I\\'ve eaten at Matt\\'s Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren\\'t spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints. \\n    So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won\\'t wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO\\'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt\\'s big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo\\'s and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt\\'s Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.\\n    Two additional points I\\'d like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt\\'s Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn\\'t a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU\\'VE been warned.\\n    If you want to try something different\\\\/unique\\\\/and worthwhile give LO LO\\'s Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don\\'t mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn\\'t value it\\'s patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not.,To be fair, we went to Matt\\'s based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr\\'s new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt\\'s Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.,I was willing to wait for 1 1\\\\/2 hour  for the best breakfast I  was reading about ... boy, I was disappointed.\\n\\nCON:\\n*Bacon was dry .. really really dry\\n*Hash brown  ... burnt on the outside soggy with butter on the inside. Don\\'t get me wrong. I love my butter .. but that was just way too much.\\n*Tables are tiny - we had 3 pple and a toddler  and they put us with a table  for 2. Please explain to me how we were suppose to eat ?\\n\\nPRO:\\n*Matt was really nice\\n*Service was great\\n*The sour dough bread with blueberry jam was really good.\\n\\nWill I go back ?  ... No.,After hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it\\'s cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the \\'hog & chick\\' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my \\'hog\\' on to my hungry hog\\n\\nloving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I\\'m very picky on the poach... Not like it\\'s a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I\\'ve never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn\\'t test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It\\'s presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It\\'s next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I\\'ll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I\\'m thinking I\\'m seriously picky with my breakfast\\\\/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I\\'m goin back to Cali..,So after many years if wanting to Dine at Matt\\'s Big Breakfast today was the day.  I have read the rave reviews and was excited but that did not last long.  The first disappointment was they moved up the street and gone is the diner feel I so wanted.  The wait was long, about 45 minutes on a Thursday late morning but we were finally seated and the immediate feel was less diner and more industrial.  The server was quick to the table with water and a quick rundown of the daily special.  My partner and I looked over the very brief and very over priced menu and we decided on the breakfast special and a lunch sandwich, it was 11:15 so we thought we would try some lunch.  Ugh....after waiting over 30 minutes we got up to leave, I was hungry and the staff had now deserted us so we were going to leave.   At this time a woman, I can only assume she was the manager came up and said the food was coming.  We declined.  She said she could box the food to go, we declined.  She then said the wait was our fault, you see we ordered lunch.  So sad, I won\\'t be back i will stay a loyal customer of Joes Diner were the food is appropriately priced, the service is great and the staff does not blame the guest for ordering lunch.,I went by myself and waited an hour and a half on a Thursday morning. The hostess was rude, after a mix up when she called me (the name she called before me didn\\'t come so she went to seat me, but then realized that she said the name wrong so I waited ten more minutes and then she called tables who were after me), she told me \"oh there\\'s a table inside in the corner you can go now\". I felt super rushed and that I was inconveniencing the restaurant. The waiter I had seemed not all there. The food was ok but definitely not worth the hype and price.,This was a case of high expectations falling short. After seeing it on a Food Network show and reading about it in numerous sources, I had high hopes for Matt\\'s Big Breakfast. After waiting for 45 minutes, we made it inside the tiny restaurant.  \\n\\nEverything was ok, but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate their no microwave, no freezer rule, but I feel it didn\\'t live up to the hype I had read\\\\/heard about. \\n\\nMaybe I\\'m just spoiled by good Bay Area coffee options, but the coffee here was BAD. The salami scramble was pretty average and the Belgian waffle for which a lot of people rave about, was fine, but again, didn\\'t stand out as amazing. The thick cut bacon was awesome and a nice accompaniment to the waffle. \\n\\nHowever, waiting for 45 minutes and feeling rushed to get out the door, just isn\\'t worth it.,I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt\\'s on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don\\'t know what hole in the wall \"amazing\" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using \"local\" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \\n\\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take \"over easy\" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that\\'s what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can\\'t even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \\n\\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn\\'t have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I\\'m sure glad I didn\\'t for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that\\'s not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................,If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieri\\'s favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didn\\'t do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasn\\'t enough pesto to grab my attention.\\n \\nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them: very thinly-sliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.\\n \\nYes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I won\\'t dock any points for that, even though it was in 100+ degree weather; waiting is all part of the experience.,Checked-in and asked for a cup of coffee. Woman at register was a complete bi!$& and was completely disgruntled and on a huge power trip.  I had to purchase a coffee to go and she threw my card onto the counter.,My dad and I went there for Breakfast.  It is a little hole in the wall joint which only seats about 15 people.  The prices are high for the amount of Food.  Three pancakes were $8.00 and they were not big at all less than half the plate.  My dad had a bowl of oatmeal which cost $5.50.  I was not impressed the food was just average nothing to rave about.  Also there is no parking except on the street which has meters and no bathroom you have to go to the hotel next door which has a bathroom.  It is very cramped and hardly any room.  I was impressed they had organic milk on the menu but beside this the food was just average.  I suggest not to make a special trip unless you\\'re a DDD person and want to experience it like most of the customers were when we were there.,I have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.\\n\\nI called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don\\'t know why that bothers me so much, maybe it\\'s just because you should know how to operate your phone?\\n\\nWhen I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It\\'s like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good. \\n\\nI got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS. \\n\\nThe omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn\\'t taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham. \\n\\nThe wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.\\n\\nDon\\'t order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don\\'t know if they thought I was heading to the airport? \\n\\nAnyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking.,I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt\\'s Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny\\'s.  I will not return.,I waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn\\'t anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn\\'t get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it.,So....finally went.....and am graciously giving one more star. But that\\'s about it.\\n\\nOf COURSE triple D keeps finding places in Arizona to broadcast shows from. Is this a big news flash or something? We should be the \"Wide Load\" state. Guy F happens to be a lard, so of course he\\'s gonna B-line towards this shrinky-dinked, over-hyped and over-booked lil\\' nook that serves portions which could very well springboard the next season of \"1000 Pound Dad\".\\n\\nThe whole \"Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment\" is getting really, REALLY old, Phoenix! Get off your arses and find some places on your own instead of waiting for Food Network to whip you into a manufactured frenzy.\\n\\nI don\\'t see the point of going, WAITING (and yes - it\\'s true - they don\\'t give wait times {get OVER yourselves}), and then being squished in seats and then paying for portions you can\\'t possibly finish. How about more varied ingredients rather than a hunger-relief-in-Africa portion of potatoes on my plate?\\n\\nNOW I know why some Scottdalers adore and coddle this place:  It makes \\'em feel adventurous. What\\'s more edgy than coming to the semi-impoverished Roosevelt district, parking by a seedy motel (where \"those\" people live), gorging on local bacon and UFO size pancakes, and then safely returning home to the trials of spending the afternoon at Williams-Sonoma? Please.\\n\\nThe flavors are good, but not unique for breakfast. Pancakes were fluffy, but not better than my Pop\\'s. It seems the hype is in the portions, the TV exposure, and the limited seating. People see a line and wanna go wait in it, for some reason. The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion: there\\'s nothing new here, folks. It\\'s breakfast. It\\'s huge. And I couldn\\'t care less.,So I\\'m watching Diners, Drive-in\\'s and Dive\\'s on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can\\'t believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we\\'re all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I\\'ll stick to IHOP.,Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I\\'d eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\\n\\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.,way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you\\'re eating!  how much was the oj again?,I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \\nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \\nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again.,Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn\\'t skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don\\'t give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it\\'s my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won\\'t be back.,I\\'m not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it\\'s the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there\\'s not one...and no, I don\\'t like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I\\'ve waited in line once--that\\'ll be enough for me, Matt.,EVERYONE hyped this place up waaaaay too much. I waited with 2 friends for 1.5 hours. I got a Cheese\\\\/Sausage omelet with grilled onions... it came with a piece of toast, 2 eggs (I think), and hash browns.\\n\\nPeople seem to talk about the hash browns... I don\\'t see whats so special. Shredded potato that\\'s burnt on the top and bottom, while hella soggy in the middle... is not my idea of damn good hash browns.\\n\\nIn my honest opinion, if you like A LOT of butter on everything, as well as waiting in line for a hour and a half, for a chance to sit down in a crazy small restaurant... then this is the breakfast stop for you.,i dont think they care that they are so rude. the worst service i have ever had. i was amazed that they would treat their customers like that.\\n\\n i will not spend any money there,I\\'m probably the lone dissenter in the land of Five star reviews here, but here goes. \\n\\nI wanted to love Matt\\'s. It\\'s adorable and close to home. \\n\\nI don\\'t eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That\\'s fine, it\\'s not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that\\'s what my kitchen is for. \\n\\nI had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease. \\n\\nMatt\\'s is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won\\'t be back.,I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5\\'1\" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.,Visiting Phoenix and I wanted to revisit Matt\\'s.  I was here two years ago and I had heard that they moved, 4 months ago, to a new larger space.   \\n\\nThe new space is nice, but I somehow miss the tiny old one.  The little place was unique and atmospheric where the new place is cool, but somehow generic-cool.  \\n\\nStaff was nice enough, but it put me off a bit when they wanted $1.50 for more maple syrup.   I said OK because the pancakes were SUPER DRY.   Not good at all.   And the maple syrup is totally sub par.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  It\\'s stored in big plastic jugs in the dining room.   \\n\\nFriend\\'s omelette was overcooked and greasy.   Potatoes were just average.   Thick cut marble rye toast was good, but then he loves anything rye.\\n\\nCome on Matt, you can do better.   Spend more time training your kitchen staff.  And does your wife always wear UGGs, no matter the weather?,Very disappointed... Nice clean place and very friendly staff, but the food just really isn\\'t that good!  The coffee was weak but flavorful, the OJ was good (freshly squeezed), the wheat toast with preserves was good, the pancake was very plain, the home fries were bland and covered in grease, the pork chop was under seasoned\\\\/bland, and the eggs were good but greasy.  Not worth the wait in my opinion.,Does anyone actually wait more than once for this?  We waited 1 hour; thankfully, it was a beautiful morning.  Once inside we had trouble sitting on the bar stools, they are so small and slippery.(We aren\\'t large people)\\n  I stood up to eat my breakfast.  My husband enjoyed his Iowa pork chop, but my ham and cheese omelet was generic.,The menu is pretty lameski if you don\\'t go in for a lot of meat.  Here\\'s my problem with Matt\\'s: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you\\'re paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That\\'s pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?  \\n\\nI\\'ve eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.  \\n\\nNot worth the wait.,My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place. \\nFirst impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\\nThe coffee\\'s great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \\n\\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \\n\\nThe jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.,Overpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn\\'t going \"wow\" because of the price. I don\\'t mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet.,I did not wait long to try this place after going to the farmers market. I have had way way better. The food was so so. My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor. I actually find that a lot in Phoenix...PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD HERE!!!! Look at most of the bad reviews and see where most of the people are from. Yeah, not here with exception of myself but I am actually from Los Angeles and have had access all my live to some of the best food around. Matt\\'s big breakfast is a big joke! I actually prefer to go to wildflower over this joint.,Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt\\'s a fair shake.  Listen, it\\'s not terrible...but it\\'s just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a \"hot spot,\" but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It\\'s small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I\\'m done with this place.,I am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.,I\\'ve decided to make this one short and sweet...\\n\\nThe Menu - Too Small.\\nThe Food - Good, but nothing special.\\nThe Service - Stellar.\\nThe Aesthetics - Cute, 5&Diner-ish, CRAMPED!\\nThe Wait - Too long & clearly not worth it.\\n\\nJust because Guy Fieri ate here...Puh-leeze. 2 Stars because I genuinely appreciate a warm and attentive wait staff.,OVERRATED.\\n\\nI know it was reviewed on Food network channel as top 10 something or another in the nation.  Did their quality go down since they know that people will seek it out irregardless of the review?\\n\\nLocation- in down town Phoenix- but in a crappy part that doesn\\'t look safe at night.  Dirt lot in back is not an option to park because of city ordinances or safety issues.\\n\\nWait time- for those reviewers who waited over 1hour in the hot desert sun- i don\\'t know what to say. There is little to no shade, it\\'s hot, you lean on wooden fences... it\\'s a strange system where you sign your name to be called. However, if you sign in, and say you want to go do something else instead of wait an hour in the hot sun, they will cross you off the list if you aren\\'t there for roll call. Some people behind us, just waited a bit then walked in and sat at the bar (where they were seating other people).  And they say they don\\'t play favorites?  Please....  If you can\\'t stand to wait, you can  order take out and get your food before all the other people waiting.  Do they let anyone know? NO. Do they care that people waiting over 1 hour have to wait another hour for food so To-Go people can get their food? NO...\\n\\nFood- maybe the food tastes better because your out in the hot sun,dehydrating, standing, waiting... because the food didn\\'t look like anything special and didn\\'t taste special either.  Just run of the mill breakfast food.  Does it take 45min to make waffles and toast?  We told them we had a flight to catch, and our food took a crazy amount of time to make. No wonder the wait is so long outside! 2oz of OJ was $2.50\\n\\nAmbiance- it\\'s a 3 room (1 kitchen, one bar set up, 1 room with 4 tables and seating on bar-like thing looking outside. Think they can seat ~20 people inside?  Poor decor, crappy furniture.... they must make a ton of money because none of it is going into the location\\\\/upkeep\\\\/decor.\\n\\nDon\\'t even think about coming here with more than 6 people.... Where will you put them? Wait til the restaurant clears so you have a room to yourself?  ha...\\n\\nOnce again, OVER-RATED.,Sooooo overrated.  I\\'ve been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don\\'t mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny\\'s fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny\\'s.  I haven\\'t been to Denny\\'s in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt\\'s Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.,Told this was the best in town so made multiple attempts to go, but left twice because the wait was over 2 hrs... When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable, found the food was good but not worth the hype.  Plus, had to ask 3 times for my side waffle, and when it was brought out she poured the syrup all over me and made only a half effort to clean it up.,My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt\\'s, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.\\n\\nSo, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn\\'t get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn\\'t tast whatever they used.  I didn\\'t understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.\\n\\nHungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can\\'t handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt\\'s for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt\\'s.,Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. \\n1. There was hair in one of our waffle plates. \\n2. The servers were not very attentive. \\n3. When we had a mistake on an order, the waitress rudely confronted us instead of being accommodating.\\n 4. I had to wait over 5 minutes (after the rest of my party had walked out) just for them to notice I was waiting for the check. And last when I paid the bill they did not bother to ask how everything was. Poor service ruins even a great meal and I will NEVER return and let my friends know to not bother going there.,Ok, someone please explain something to me, WHAT ON EARTH HAS MADE THIS PLACE SO POPULAR????? I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny\\'s in America makes a better breakfast and you don\\'t have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don\\'t get it. The only thing that \"wasn\\'t\" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. \"Good food, good portion size, good price\". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don\\'t think Matts would be in business much longer.,Came here on a Thursday morning with the boyfriend to eat and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got to work after a night out At the club. I couldn\\'t decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn\\'t have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn\\'t. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn\\'t even eat my food. I wouldn\\'t even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters.,An hour and a half wait...I thought after seeing this on DDD (from the Food Network) that it has to be pretty darn good considering how they raved about it. Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny\\'s. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down.,We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt\\'s.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.  \\n\\nThe door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that \"that table is set for three\".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three \"men\"  cruise over to the table \"set for three\"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..\\n\\nI will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast.,basically i dont give a rat\\'s **s on what the majority say i have never been treated like this in my life! saw it on foodnetwork, we just moved to az a month ago from los angeles. so after a 2 hr wait and it rained.....we were seated and for $4 we get a teeny cup of oj fresh squeezed i might add. we get the waffles with potatoes and thick bacon. it was ok but not worth the wait w\\\\/ kids! i didnt tip her becuz she just acted snippy. but we spent $47 so oh well. she comes running out the store like we stole something! was everything ok? (loud as ever) nevermind its a crowd waiting oiutside..she says rather loud...u didnt tip my server i said lady get out of my face u actlike i didnt pay the bill. its gratuity and there was no gratitude. i said your millionares after that show ...damn b&^%$# i will never go back. i also disputed the charge becuz she has the nerve to add 4 dollars in the tip line that i presigned. sheesh!,After hearing rave reviews, we finally went to try for first time.  Between the long wait time just to be seated, poor service, the constant waiting and having to ask for refills.  We even went to the front and asked for our check rather than continuing to wait for it.  The food was good no doubt about it, but with as much hypster hype as there has been about Matt\\'s Big Breakfast, we expected better.  Probably wont be back....,More like matt\\'s small breakfast!\\n\\nThe big name and high prices were certainly not reflected in the portion sizes. That being said, the portions were more than enough for me and I left with a full tummy. Some of the ingredients were organic and local (yay!!), but the actual food was nothing special. In fact, the raspberry preserves were the most impressive thing I ate at matt\\'s. I feel like I could have cooked everything there (and probably more to my liking) with the ingredients in my refrigerator and saved a chunk of change.,I think Matt\\'s has had its \\'5 minutes of fame\\'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you\\'re next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won\\'t go again, won\\'t recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your \\'waiting area\\' customers out .,I don\\'t get the rave reviews or how anybody can claim that this is the \"be all, end all\" for breakfast.  \\n\\nPros-\\nA friendly server\\nDecent bacon, though heavy on the pepper\\n\\nCons-\\nOverpriced for what you get-$7.50 for pancakes a la carte and my personal favorite $1.25 extra charge for more syrup!  With a side of bacon and a coffee that meal alone was $12 before tax & gratuity.\\n1 slice of toast with a 2 egg breakfast...who does that?\\n6oz Orange Juice....$2.50!\\nThree in your party, oh I\\'m sorry you will have to squeeze into the corner with an extra chair because we won\\'t seat you at a table for four is how the visit started!\\n\\nI understand why everyone claims that it is always so busy, there might be 20 seats in the entire place!  Not going to be back any time soon with all of the other options downtown for breakfast these days.,In the movie \"The 40-Year Old Virgin,\" there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: \"You\\'re putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that\\'s your problem!\"\\n\\nMatt\\'s Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We\\'d tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \"What\\'s the probable wait time?\" We were told, \"Oh we don\\'t really provide anyone with wait times.\" The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn\\'t really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we\\'d turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \\n\\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \"Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\"\\n\\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt\\'s Big Breakfast and now I\\'m waiting for my heart attack.\\n\\nI\\'d tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \"traditional breakfast food\" so \"different.\"\\n\\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\\n\\nThe omelette was more like \"Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\" The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They\\'re not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they\\'re ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\\n\\nI\\'m one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \"go there\" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I\\'ll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\\n\\nIt was a\\'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people\\'s palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don\\'t know. The ingredients were definitely \"real,\" which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny\\'s. It most definitely beats \"Moons Over My Hammy\" for instance.\\n\\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\\n\\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it\\'s BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \"That\\'s a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\" while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\\n\\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \\n\\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I\\'m not. I\\'m a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick\\'s Hideaway several times a week. It\\'s just that at Dick\\'s Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I\\'m used to having an entire day\\'s worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I\\'ll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won\\'t eat meat for meat\\'s sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn\\'t an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\\n\\nThe \"thick-cut bacon\" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it\\'s hard to do bad.\\n\\nI see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950\\'s signs that say \"Eggs!\" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it\\'s better than Denny\\'s, and it\\'s better than 5 & Diner. It\\'s NOT \"The Best\" and it\\'s most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.\\n\\nThe chalkboard on the wall inside says \"Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner.\" I hadn\\'t known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it\\'s worth the wait.\\n\\nI\\'m glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.,I like the bright, small-diner atmosphere and the use of cage-free eggs, organic produce and grain-fed natural Iowa pork and Angus beef.  I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website, \"We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you\" quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in.  My stomach couldn\\'t take it.  I guess if I go back for breakfast, I can always get the Frosted Flakes for $4.,Met friends for breakfast this morning and was sadly disappointed.  I expected the 30 minute wait, but did not expect the over cooked eggs.  Now I did ask for crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns and neither came out that way.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I do not expect I will go back again.,After all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was $16.01.  \\n\\nThe pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink-wrap packages. Even funnier the \"three pieces\" were actuallly only 1\\\\/2 pieces of bacon at around 4\" long. Overall I\\'ve had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price. \\n\\nAnother disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move.  The employee did finally move her car but she didn\\'t bother to apologize.,Ugh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I\\'m not nuts.  And there is no way I\\'m going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt\\'s is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room.,I\\'ve been to Matt\\'s a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.\\n\\nMatt\\'s is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It\\'s impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won\\'t let you sit at a table, so you\\'re stuck at their crappy counter.  (don\\'t get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)\\n\\nOne of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren\\'t that remarkable.\\n\\nMatt\\'s won\\'t be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I\\'ll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don\\'t want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait.,Went to matt\\'s the other day to see what the rave is about and just as I expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more. The service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best. It was not that the food was bad, however, if you can\\'t be seated right away it\\'s not worth the wait. This is not a special place. No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with. I saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards....I mean what did he eat? And how much did it cost!!!!?? Anyway, if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt\\'s. Nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your 15 minutes of fame has long been expired. Making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show..trust me this is my review and I was seated right away just imagine if I had to wait in line what the review would say. Save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day. I give matt\\'s 5 stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and I give them another 5 stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one\\'s taste buds. Do yourself a favor when you pass by this \\nplace and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that won\\'t   Molest your good senses.\\n\\nTo make it you have to rely on your food and staff........not guy fieti and the food network!,Seriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?\\n\\nIt\\'s so small, it\\'s impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they\\'re trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.  \\n\\nThe food - it\\'s a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don\\'t have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.,This place has horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place for some time. Put my name on the list up front, checked it three times. The third time my name was scratched off. In this hour of waiting I hadn\\'t even been acknowledged. I love small places like this and don\\'t mind waiting, but I would rather drive to Tucson and wait for a table at Franks or BoBos than go back and try this place again. No food is good enough for an hour+ wait and to be forgotten. Again, don\\'t bother.,I was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt\\'s Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others.  The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don\\'t expect anything fancy or fusion.  \\n\\nMy waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting\\\\/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.\\n\\nStandard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about.,The one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer? \\n\\nWe waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There\\'s some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don\\'t take up a table too long), I wasn\\'t very hungry and definitely didn\\'t want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us. \\n\\nI ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn\\'t that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn\\'t get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good. \\n\\nThe wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it\\'s not their fault and there\\'s nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable.,If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny\\'s or IHOP.  Trust me you\\'ll pay half as much and leave feeling less icky.\\n\\nI seriously don\\'t understand the draw of this place.  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people, so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table.  Other reviews claim much longer wait times.  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly.  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint.  Seriously Food Network I don\\'t understand what all the fuss is about.  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread.  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend\\'s bread had a little something extra...a nice long hair.  Disgusting!!  \\n\\nNever again.,It\\'s about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt\\'s Big Breakfast.\\nThis place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy\\\\/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back.\\nThough, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?\\n\\nWell, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.\\n\\nThat\\'s about it.\\nEnd of review.\\n\\nNo... got to be a little more honest here.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours\\' wait in line and\\\\/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you\\'ll be honest to admit that there\\'s far better elsewhere.\\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you\\'ll think that the proprietor\\'s must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt\\'s menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it\\'s all fake kissy-kiss talk.  \"Phooey!\", I say.\\n\\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I\\'m saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... \"coffee\".  Sincerely.  I\\'ve heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn\\'t everyone have a knowing that if you\\'re going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it\\'s the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt\\'s will hear none of that; they don\\'t seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don\\'t return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who\\'d commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\\n\\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I\\'m talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\\nNonetheless, give Matt\\'s a try at least once.\\nAt least.\\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, \"Don\\'t go into the light!\" as they say of near death experiences.,Wait, you\\'re shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way.,I\\'ve been hearing good things about this place for so long, it was ridiculous I hadn\\'t yet been. I\\'m all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I\\'ve been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don\\'t have French toast. \"French toast is seasonal\". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don\\'t like. Maybe I\\'m greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn\\'t even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn\\'t meet up to expectations IMO. If I\\'m craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino\\'s for brunch on Saturday\\\\/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service. Likely a shorter wait, too.,Wow, this is absolutely the most average place i\\'ve ever eaten breakfast.  Not much different than national chains.  Way overrated.  Do not go out of your way to eat here, you\\'ll do just as well at a large chain.,Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn\\'t look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back.,Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.,I was sooooo disappointed!  I really cannot rate the food as I never got to eat. I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt\\'s. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn\\'t sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I\\'ve been waiting like I said for \"2\" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you\\'ll wait forever!,I ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben. \\n\\nSERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer.\\nTASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them. \\nVALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it. \\n\\nOVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE\\nWill I be going back?... probably not. \\nWill I recommend to a friend... NO!,I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here\\'s what I concluded\\n\\n1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.\\n\\n2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.\\n\\n3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.\\n\\n4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.\\n\\n5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?\\n\\n\\n\\nAll in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.  \\n\\nBTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.,i have tried three times on weekends to get in here, usually not in top form, i may have thrown up the parking lot once...sorry.\\nbut on a sunny thursday morning i manged to get in without much fuss.\\n\\nusually the fussiness is outside, oh! there is shade now jane l. this makes sense because summer is ovah...duh. so anywho...screaming tots a go go. this is a tiny place...why would you bring your spawn here? i hear tell ihop has balloon animals? maybe you could have them fashion  an anchor shaped balloon creation to match your tattoo flash inspired t-shirt? \\n\\nthe choices here are slim but the portions are large as well as the amount of grease. hey i like grease...but like red grease dripping out of the back end of my burrito at 4 a.m. because in the gleaming light of the morning it makes me feel so dirty. i had the oats, surprisingly grease free and my partner in breakfast crime had the cheese omelette. i also ordered home fries on the side, some have complained about the rosemary...mine had rosemary, but it looked like it was accidental. pretty bland and boring. the entire experience was pretty bland and boring. i don\\'t see what all of the fuss is about, sure it\\'s good, but it\\'s also breakfast...how hard can it be?,Overhyped?\\nWhat am I missing here?\\nI was very excited about checking out Matt\\'s. We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book).\\nThere was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn\\'t longer than that.\\nThe exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny! \\nThey had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room.\\nI had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn\\'t crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though.\\nMy toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread.\\nThere is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it\\'s super creepy.\\nBack to the food. I didn\\'t notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp.\\nNo one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph).\\nThe service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite.\\nMy husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special.\\nThere was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away.,Well going against the grain for sure but, this is one really over-rated joint. Not even worth the wait. I came here like at least 8 others that were waiting out front because we saw Matt\\'s on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV so it was one of those \"Hey that my town, We gotta go!\"\\nI ordered one of the plates I saw on the show, the Chop and Chick, a large succulent boneless pork chop, 3 perfectly cooked eggs, nice crispy brown hash browns, thick hand sliced toast, \\nWhats not to like right,?\\nWell waiting on the sidewalk out front at Matt\\'s for 1.5hrs to finally get into Breakfast Nirvana, order up and here you go \\n1 thin 25% bone pork chop over cooked and dry. Ever compare a Big Mac in an ad to the one you get in a box and you\\'ll see my point here.\\n3 eggs still slimy and runny, medium eggs means medium\\n1 huge helping of hash browns that I could have cooked the next 6 orders of eggs with the grease they wallowed in.\\nSourdough Toast, 4 stars perfect, excellent.\\nSo not all bad, just way over rated, and the following day a really great breakfast at a real local spot Big Daddy\\'s up on Cave Creek Rd and Peoria, excellent in every way and we had never been there for breakfast before but we will be back, Matt\\'s not a chance.,This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.\\n\\nThey have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren\\'t very exciting or bold.\\n\\nThe strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.\\n\\nI doubt I will return.  If I\\'m going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.\\n\\nMy wife liked it better than I did.  It\\'s really not bad, but if I\\'m going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian.,I know this isn\\'t going to sit well with a lot of Yelpers, but I was markedly underwhelmed by Matt\\'s.  I had high expectations considering the avid reviews (and the feature on the Food Network), but frankly, I was disappointed.\\n\\nI was expecting quite the wait to be seated considering the popularity of the place (and the line when I got there), but since I was dining alone, I was seated immediately.  Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.\\n\\nI started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that\\'s not really where I\\'m hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.\\n\\nAs far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.\\n\\nBecause of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.  As it stands now, though, I\\'m less than enthused.\\n\\nLay off the herbs - they\\'re best used sparingly.  They\\'re potatoes, not a salad.,Overpriced. Bland. If this is what Phoenicians rave about, no wonder they\\'re so unhappy...,OMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. \\n\\nFood. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato\\'s and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato\\'s were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. \\nI am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like \"the breakfast club\".,I will not be back. \\n\\nYes, the food is very very good... but it is not the best breakfast I\\'ve ever had. \\n\\nWe waited outside for an hour.  There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.    \\n\\nThe service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating\\\\/the inside.  If you need to use the restroom, they send you to the hotel next door.,So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt\\'s Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, \"How is the food?\"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once.'"
